	<h1>Our Menu</h1>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<p1 id="chicken"> Chicken
	</p1> 
     Why eat chicken, when there are so many other delicious alternatives without all the carnage. Imagine a world without the mass slaughter or animals who live their lives in overcrowded cages to then be hung upside down and dunked in a boiling vat of water. Eat tofu instead.

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
	<p2 id="beef"> Beef
	 </p2> There is a world where cows can roam free. They freely eat the grass on each grassy knoll they pass. Their calves stay with them and get the nutrients they need and are free from the cages that fatten them up for high priced plates of veal. Seitan is a nice plant based alternative.

	<p3 id="sushi">Sushi
	</p3>
	  Our oceans are quickly filling up with plastic. We have already overfished the oceans, rivers and streams. We now farm fish in unhealthy, overpopulated, bacteria infested vats of water. Their lives are limited and their nutritional value depleted. In fact you ingest more harm than good. For Sushi try fresh vegetables wrapped in rice and seaweed instead. </div>
